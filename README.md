# Horror Game Final Project by Aryan, Anand, Jackson
Trapped is a game where you’ve been captured by the Trapsmith, a murderer who has a talent for designing traps but has resorted to capturing victims in his workshop to test them. Within our game the player’s goal is to figure out how to exit the workshop and escape from the Trapsmith. The player can navigate the environment, avoiding being killed by the Trapsmith. They are looking for a few different items - household items, the Trapsmith’s notes, and crafting materials. Everyday household items serve as keys for progression. It is the player’s job to figure out what items grant access to what areas and find out which items to get next to eventually find the sequence of events to unlock the exit. For example, a screw driver can unlock a vault that holds a key, but that vault might be in a room that you need a flashlight to see in. How do you explore while the Trapsmith is patrolling his workshop? Luckily he has left his notes all over the place, which detail crafting recipes for the traps he’s worked on. Using the crafting materials you can find all over the workshop, you can use the recipes to learn how to make the traps the Trapsmith makes and use it against him. Clever placement of these traps can be used to stun or confuse the Trapsmith, buying the player more time. The player must find and utilize all of these items while avoiding the Trapsmith to be able to escape the workshop.
